tests:
    end to end:
        ☐ simple examples of landscapes

    unit:
        ☐ collapse function
        ☐ combination rules make sense check


efficiency:
    ☐ Make collapse() function return whcih cells are affected for more efficiency
    ☐ Pre-make the unfinished grid, so its more performant
    ☐ Just a pixel image instead of buttons? Probably also more performant.

ongiong:
    ✔ Confusion between height and width. Need extra abstraction? @done(25-12-13 19:14)
    ✔ remove old plotting code and everything that relies on it @done(25-12-14 18:30)
    ☐ landscape vs wavefunction confusion(Also 'Wavefunction' class has a 'self.wavefunction' property)
    ☐ fix better undetermined color, like pink/white grid texture?
    ☐ Border around undetermined cells, to make it easier to see which are undetermined?
    ☐ to_remove vs forbidden vs chosen in collapse() function usage.
    ☐ Figure out what the hell is going on in render_cell code. especially removing old widtgets.
    ☐ Figure otu what to do when in state that cant be fixed.
    ☐ Show number of tiles that something can be instead
    ☐ Make button to collapse a random point of lowest entropy
    ☐ Order the tiles in "choice mode"



plotting:

    matplotlib:
        ✘ Just pixel positions instead of a plot @cancelled(25-10-06 22:08)
    alternatives:
        ✔ Try pygame @done(25-10-06 22:07)
        ✔ Try tkinter @done(25-10-06 22:07)
        ✔ try PyQt6 @done(25-10-06 22:07)

    migrate to pyqt6:
        investigate:
            ✔ Can add pictures @done(25-10-21 20:15)
            ✔ Can make grid of buttons @done(25-10-21 20:22)
            ✔ can remove borders @done(25-10-21 20:22)
            ✔ can make clickable @done(25-10-21 20:22)
        migrate current:
            ✔ Plot collapsed wf. No button action @done(25-12-11 23:00)
            ✔ Plot uncollapsed wf. @done(25-12-13 18:25)
            ✔ Plot completely undetermined grid @done(25-12-13 19:55)
            ✔ Collapse full with button click @done(25-12-13 23:07)
            ✔ Collapse single cell with button click @done(25-12-13 23:07)
            ✔ Show which tiles are possible @done(25-12-13 23:07)
            ✔ Choose specific tile @done(25-12-13 23:07)
        Add pixel tiles:
            like a pixel tile with forest/lake/stream/road etc.


Data structures:
    ☐ General cleanup
    ☐ Make some dataclasses for this
    ☐ Pydantic?

extensions:
    ☐ combination rules make sense check
    ☐ clickable bitmap
    ☐ animation of process - Good for debugging
    ☐ probability on combination rules of wfc
    ☐ Split every grid into smaller sections, so we can see what the "preliminary" result is
    ☐ add logging

other stuff:
    ☐ Perlin noise? ( minecraft thing)
    ☐ gaussion probability distributions on top of each other


???:
    ☐ instead of legal/illegal: possibilty to spawn based on sorroundings.
    ☐ Button to increase order / button to shuffle?
    ☐ animate wfc process

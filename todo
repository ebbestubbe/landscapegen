tests:
    end to end:
        ☐ simple examples of landscapes

    unit:
        ☐ collapse function
        ☐ combination rules make sense check




plotting:

    matplotlib:
        ✘ Just pixel positions instead of a plot @cancelled(25-10-06 22:08)
    alternatives:
        ✔ Try pygame @done(25-10-06 22:07)
        ✔ Try tkinter @done(25-10-06 22:07)
        ✔ try PyQt6 @done(25-10-06 22:07)

    migrate to pyqt6:
        investigate:
            ✔ Can add pictures @done(25-10-21 20:15)
            ✔ Can make grid of buttons @done(25-10-21 20:22)
            ✔ can remove borders @done(25-10-21 20:22)
            ✔ can make clickable @done(25-10-21 20:22)
        migrate current:
            ☐ Plot collapsed wf. No button action
            ☐ Plot uncollapsed wf.
            ☐ Collapse full with button click
            ☐ Collapse single cell with button click
            ☐ Show which tiles are possible
            ☐ Choose specific tile
        Add pixel tiles:
            ...



collapsing:
    ☐ Collapse

Data structures:
    ☐ General cleanup
    ☐ Make some dataclasses for this
    ☐ Pydantic?

extensions:
    ☐ combination rules make sense check
    ☐ clickable bitmap
    ☐ animation of process - Good for debugging
    ☐ probability on combination rules of wfc
    ☐ Split every grid into smaller sections, so we can see what the "preliminary" result is
    ☐ add logging

other stuff:
    ☐ Perlin noise? ( minecraft thing)
    ☐ gaussion probability distributions on top of each other


???:
    ☐ instead of legal/illegal: possibilty to spawn based on sorroundings.
    ☐ Button to increase order / button to shuffle?
    ☐ animate wfc process

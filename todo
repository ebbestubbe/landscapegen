tests:
    end to end:
        ☐ simple examples of landscapes

    unit:
        ☐ collapse function
        ☐ combination rules make sense check


efficiency:
    ☐ Make collapse() function return whcih cells are affected for more efficiency
    ☐ Pre-make the unfinished grid, so its more performant
    ☐ Just a pixel image instead of buttons? Probably also more performant.
    ☐ Unclickable pixmal: should it be generated first as a png, or is the checkerboard_pixmap ok?
    ☐ Time generation of 10x10, 30x30, 60x60 etc for performance test.
    ☐ The function to render cells takes in a list of cells to rerender. But all cells are added to this dict. Optimize by only adding those with new

misc:
    ☐ Figure out what the hell is going on in render_cell code. especially removing old widtgets.
    ☐ Figure out what partial() functools does
    ✔ Confusion between height and width. Need extra abstraction? @done(25-12-13 19:14)
    ✔ remove old plotting code and everything that relies on it @done(25-12-14 18:30)
    ✔ fix better undetermined color, like pink/white grid texture? @done(25-12-17 20:08)
    ☐ landscape vs wavefunction confusion(Also 'Wavefunction' class has a 'self.wavefunction' property)
    ☐ to_remove vs forbidden vs chosen in collapse() function usage.
    ☐ Merge initial and collapse_cell code
    ☐ Figure otu what to do when in state that cant be fixed.
    ☐ Show number of tiles that something can be instead
    ☐ Prettier tiles
    ☐ Border around undetermined cells, to make it easier to see which are undetermined?
    ✔ Order the tiles in "choice mode" @done(25-12-17 22:02)
    ☐ doesnt make extra space between tiles when increasing height of window

probabilities:
    ☐ Større sandsynligheder for at få tile X hvis den er ved siden af flere X
    ☐ Show average color of possibility of tiles
    ✔ Count tiles and neighbors from existing pixelmap. @done(25-12-26 19:31)
    ☐ save tile info as well.
    ☐ free form for clicking rules
    ✔ load rules from pixelmap @done(25-12-25 23:04)
    ✔ save pixelmap @done(25-12-24 10:58)



plotting:

    matplotlib:
        ✘ Just pixel positions instead of a plot @cancelled(25-10-06 22:08)
    alternatives:
        ✔ Try pygame @done(25-10-06 22:07)
        ✔ Try tkinter @done(25-10-06 22:07)
        ✔ try PyQt6 @done(25-10-06 22:07)

    migrate to pyqt6:
        investigate:
            ✔ Can add pictures @done(25-10-21 20:15)
            ✔ Can make grid of buttons @done(25-10-21 20:22)
            ✔ can remove borders @done(25-10-21 20:22)
            ✔ can make clickable @done(25-10-21 20:22)
        migrate current:
            ✔ Plot collapsed wf. No button action @done(25-12-11 23:00)
            ✔ Plot uncollapsed wf. @done(25-12-13 18:25)
            ✔ Plot completely undetermined grid @done(25-12-13 19:55)
            ✔ Collapse full with button click @done(25-12-13 23:07)
            ✔ Collapse single cell with button click @done(25-12-13 23:07)
            ✔ Show which tiles are possible @done(25-12-13 23:07)
            ✔ Choose specific tile @done(25-12-13 23:07)
    Add pixel tiles:
        ☐ like a pixel tile with forest/lake/stream/road etc.
    automatic collapse:
        ✔ Button to iterate once. @done(25-12-22 00:38)
        ✔ Button to play @done(25-12-22 00:53)
        ☐ Speed selection
        ☐ Define entropy
        ☐ Define to choose lowest or highest entropy.

Data structures:
    ☐ General cleanup
    ☐ Make some dataclasses for this
    ☐ Pydantic?

extensions:
    ☐ combination rules make sense check
    ☐ clickable bitmap
    ☐ animation of process - Good for debugging
    ☐ probability on combination rules of wfc
    ☐ Split every grid into smaller sections, so we can see what the "preliminary" result is
    ☐ add logging

other stuff:
    ☐ Perlin noise? ( minecraft thing)
    ☐ gaussion probability distributions on top of each other


???:
    ☐ instead of legal/illegal: possibilty to spawn based on sorroundings.
    ☐ Button to increase order / button to shuffle?
    ☐ animate wfc process

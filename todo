tests:
    end to end:
        ☐ simple examples of landscapes

    unit:
        ☐ collapse function
        ☐ combination rules make sense check



ongiong:
    ✔ Confusion between height and width. Need extra abstraction? @done(25-12-13 19:14)
    ☐ Pre-make the unfinished grid, so its more performant
    ☐ Just a pixel image instead of buttons? Probably also more performant.
    ☐ remove old plotting code and everything that relies on it
    ☐ landscape vs wavefunction confusion
    ☐ fix better undetermined color, like pink/white grid texture?
    ☐ Border around undetermined cells, to make it easier to see which are undetermined?


plotting:

    matplotlib:
        ✘ Just pixel positions instead of a plot @cancelled(25-10-06 22:08)
    alternatives:
        ✔ Try pygame @done(25-10-06 22:07)
        ✔ Try tkinter @done(25-10-06 22:07)
        ✔ try PyQt6 @done(25-10-06 22:07)

    migrate to pyqt6:
        investigate:
            ✔ Can add pictures @done(25-10-21 20:15)
            ✔ Can make grid of buttons @done(25-10-21 20:22)
            ✔ can remove borders @done(25-10-21 20:22)
            ✔ can make clickable @done(25-10-21 20:22)
        migrate current:
            ✔ Plot collapsed wf. No button action @done(25-12-11 23:00)
            ✔ Plot uncollapsed wf. @done(25-12-13 18:25)
            ☐ Plot completely undetermined grid
            ☐ Collapse full with button click
            ☐ Collapse single cell with button click
            ☐ Show which tiles are possible
            ☐ Choose specific tile
        Add pixel tiles:
            like a pixel tile with forest/lake/stream/road etc.


Data structures:
    ☐ General cleanup
    ☐ Make some dataclasses for this
    ☐ Pydantic?

extensions:
    ☐ combination rules make sense check
    ☐ clickable bitmap
    ☐ animation of process - Good for debugging
    ☐ probability on combination rules of wfc
    ☐ Split every grid into smaller sections, so we can see what the "preliminary" result is
    ☐ add logging

other stuff:
    ☐ Perlin noise? ( minecraft thing)
    ☐ gaussion probability distributions on top of each other


???:
    ☐ instead of legal/illegal: possibilty to spawn based on sorroundings.
    ☐ Button to increase order / button to shuffle?
    ☐ animate wfc process
